This is my Galvanize Capstone Project that was done in 2 weeks as a culmination of everything I had learned in the past 6 months.

To see the live application, it is deployed to an AWS S3 Bucket at the link below.

# What is Power Ranking?

* Power Ranking is a concept that is commonly used with all sports. Various sports writers will come together and come up with a list of the top teams, in order, in the league. I took this concept and applied it to every day topics (cereals, candy, comedy movies, etc.), and created this application in two weeks.

# Why Power Ranking?

* This is something that I have been doing with friends, coworkers, and classmates for years.
* We would debate silly topics for hours. The best part about it was that our relationships grew as a cause, and we would never run out of topics to talk about.
* Another advantage is that it distracts people from more serious topics that shouldn't usually be debated (politics, religion) and creates more fun conversations.

# Technologies Used

This repository is built with Angular 2. It was my first experience transitioning from Angular 1.5 to 2, and I would totally continue working with it.

For quick styling, I chose bootstrap because of its comprehensive grid system and components.
